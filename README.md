# Asobou### Intro
The private sector faces numerous challenges but is always demanded to deliver fast and accurately.
Unfortunately though, these two qualities are very hard to meet.

This code is written as a solution to this hectic problem as we optimize this preformance mathematically using rigourous methods of probability as a way to solve this. 

The problem we're tackeling specifically here is the challanges faced by the private sector in recruitement.
<br />

### Dependencies

The only hard dependency is Django used for the back end development. 
Another (simple) dependancy is the Scipy statistical library in python whch is necessary to preform the main task of optimization.

<br />

### Quick Start

You can fork our code (as it is open source) using the git pull command (our file link) with git-bash.

If you do not have git nor git-bash, please install them from the official website (you'll thank us later, buddy). 


### Built using

Django framework for development in python 

Figma for the wyre frame and design (cuz we were running outta time)
You can access those files through the link: https://www.figma.com/file/oSKQKquWqiDFDOEm6zkCJt/Contrast-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1

We also used TeleportHQ's Figma plugin to extract the design as html, css, and js files and edit on them to make them more flexible, compatible, and  dynamic. We weren't able to complete the customization though, and so we present the functgionality of the backbone of the system (pun intended). 

### Key functions
- OG Function: The function gives the application score depending on the weighted sum of the parameters defined by the users. The weights are also defined by the users.

- Shortlisted function: This function gives an advice on how many applicants should the user internview for the final selection for the job. It's doing this depending on: 
1. The number of people needed to the specific job.
2. The index of reliability which is a percentage that shows to which extent can we rely on the data provided.
3. How many of the people you're willing to interview.

We hope this adds some more clarity to the code.
If needed we will append later on the proof and theorems used to come to such a conclusion. 

### Contributing

As for now, this code was written (from scratch) collabortively between Ahmed AbdelKhalig , Ahmed Abdelmagid, Lubna Altyaeb, and Mohammed Alfatih during the EEESE hackathon of 2022.  

### Feedback

Building better more efficient apps and methodologies is something We aspire to fullfil. Weâ€™d love to hear more about your thoughts, so feel free to reach out to us.
